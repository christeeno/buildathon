# {TERMINOUS CHATBOT} - BUILDATHON
This chatbot is a medical Q&A system built using Streamlit and Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro). It allows users to input medical-related questions, checks for relevant keywords, and generates responses in English. If a question is not medically related, the bot prompts the user to submit an appropriate query. Responses are displayed in an organized manner with expandable sections, and the conversation history is visible in the sidebar. The chatbot ensures all responses are in English using a language detection library and accurately numbers user questions for clarity.

## Technologies used

The project is a **health-related Q&A web app** that combines several technologies to provide an interactive interface powered by **Google's Gemini Pro AI**. Here's a concise breakdown of the technologies used:

1. **Google Gemini Pro**:
   - Provides AI-driven responses. The app sends user questions to the Gemini Pro model using an API key. It handles natural language understanding and generates relevant health-related answers.

2. **Streamlit**:
   - Powers the app's front-end. Streamlit enables quick development of the user interface (input fields, buttons, etc.) and manages chat history using session state. The app layout is customized using CSS.

3. **Langdetect**:
   - Ensures responses are in English. This Python library checks the language of the AI-generated responses and filters non-English replies.

4. **Python**:
   - Handles the backend logic, API integration, and response processing. Python’s simplicity enables easy integration with Google’s AI API and session management through Streamlit.

5. **API Integration**:
   - The app uses **Google Cloud API** to access Gemini Pro via API calls. The API key authenticates requests and retrieves answers securely.

### Summary:
- **User queries** are sent to the **Gemini Pro model**, checked for health relevance, and processed for English language. The app interface, built with **Streamlit**, displays the response and maintains a chat history, ensuring a smooth user experience.
