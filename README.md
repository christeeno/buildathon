# {TERMINOUS CHATBOT} - BUILDATHON
This chatbot is a medical Q&A system built using Streamlit and Google Generative AI (Gemini Pro). It allows users to input medical-related questions, checks for relevant keywords, and generates responses in English. If a question is not medically related, the bot prompts the user to submit an appropriate query. Responses are displayed in an organized manner with expandable sections, and the conversation history is visible in the sidebar. The chatbot ensures all responses are in English using a language detection library and accurately numbers user questions for clarity.
